## Combining music, film and ecology
Today, many people don't understand the importance of sustainable development for our society.  We know that, in order to improve our way of living and making it more sustainable, we first need people to be aware, we need to raise awarness on this matter.
Therefore, we decided to create a website proposing films depending on one's music taste. How is it linked to sustainable development in any form, will you ask ?
First, the user will enter the genre of music they prefer. We built a dataset in which we linked genres of music with films. We made these connections based on research, what are frequent themes addressed musics belonging to this genre and how they correspond to a certain film genre. Thus, the website will propose movies in the film genre corresponding to the music genre in the dataset, and alays with a link to sustainable development.
